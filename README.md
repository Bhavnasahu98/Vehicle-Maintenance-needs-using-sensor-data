# Vehicle-Maintenance-needs-using-sensor-data
This repository presents a data-driven system designed to predict vehicle maintenance needs using sensor data collected from various components of a vehicle. Modern vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors that provide real-time insights into operational health. By analyzing this data, we aim to forecast potential issues and enable preventive maintenance, ultimately improving vehicle safety, reliability, and cost efficiency.

# Project Overview
The system processes sensor data such as engine temperature, oil pressure, battery voltage, RPM, speed, mileage, fuel level, and brake status. Using machine learning techniques, it identifies anomalies and patterns that may indicate the need for service or part replacement. The goal is to move away from traditional reactive maintenance models and shift toward predictive maintenance using historical trends and real-time metrics.

The project pipeline includes:

Data Collection: Simulated or real-time sensor data in CSV/JSON format.

Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.

Modeling: Supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) and time-series models (e.g., LSTM) trained to detect potential faults.

Evaluation: Model accuracy and reliability are measured using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Inference: Based on sensor inputs, the system provides alerts for upcoming maintenance needs.

Visualization: Plots and dashboards to display sensor trends and health reports.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM models)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization

CSV/JSON files as sensor data input (can be integrated with IoT devices)

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
Integration with real-time OBD-II vehicle data

Deployment as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI

Interactive dashboard for live vehicle monitoring

This system can serve fleet operators, car service centers, and vehicle owners looking to reduce breakdowns and maintenance costs through intelligent predictions.
